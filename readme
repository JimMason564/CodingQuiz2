This is a multiple choice Javascript quiz game. When the start button is hit, the first question
appears and the timer begins counting down from 30 to 0. For every incorrect question 5 seconds is
deducted from the timer. The quiz is over when all the questions are answered or the timer hits 0.
Your score is the time remaining. You will then have the option to enter your initials to be stored in local storage on the high score board.
